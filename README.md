# MLmodel_breastcancer
I trained a ML model that analyses and predict if a person has breast cancer or not.
The steps that I took:
1. Choose any random dataset from Kaggle (ended up choosing breast cancer dataset)
2. Imported all the necessary libraries
3. Plotted histograms of the imported dataset
4. Divided the entire data into X and y, where y shows the target feature
5. Initiated a binary feature for y
6. Divided the data set into three sections, 60% for training, 20% for testing, 20% for valid
7. Started working on the training dataset and used k nearest neighbor for the implementation and training
8. Implemented linear regression on it and reached to predictions
9. It resulted into a 99% accuracy model
